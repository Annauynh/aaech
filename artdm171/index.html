        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>My career goal is to become a graphic designer and earn a stable living after transferring from DVC and earning a degree. After that I plan to work up to an Art Director position and earn enough to live comfortably.</p>
        
        <h2>Knowledge of Web Design</h2>
        <p>I have little to no knowledge of web design up to this point. My experience before this point has been an exposure of coding through scratch.mit.edu in middle school and a bare bones website I made for a HOT class also in middle school. Other than that, I have not pursued to learn more about web design, however, I am interested and intrigued by this course and hope to learn more.</p>
        
        <h2>What I Hope To Learn</h2>
        <p>In this class, I hope to learn about what it takes to make websites work as they do. Learning the fundamentals has already been interesting and I hope I will remain interested in the future. I am excited to learn about CSS and how to make my websites look great.</p>
