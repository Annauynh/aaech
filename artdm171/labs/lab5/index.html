           <h2>Objects of Scientific Interest</h2>
            
            <p>President George W. Bush established the monument under the authority of the Antiquities Act of 1906, which protects places of historic or scientific significance. Only recently have scientists visited the realm of the monument, observing previously unknown biological, chemical, and geological wonders of nature.</p>

               <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench">The Mariana Trench</a> is the deepest place on Earth, deeper than the height of Mount Everest above sea level. It is five times longer than the Grand Canyon and includes some 50,532,102 acres that are virtually unknown to humans.</p>

                                <p>The Volcanic Unit – an arc of undersea mud volcanoes and thermal vents – supports unusual life forms in some of the harshest conditions imaginable. Here species survive in the midst of hydrothermal vents that produce highly acidic and boiling water.</p>

                    <p>The submerged caldera at Maug is one of only a few known places in the world where photosynthetic and chemosynthetic communities of life co-exist. The caldera is some 1.5 miles wide and 820 feet deep, an unusual depth for lagoons. The lava dome in the center of the crater rises to within 65 feet of the surface. Hydrothermal vents at about 475 feet in depth along the northeast side of the dome spew acidic water at scalding temperatures near the coral reef that quickly ascends to the sea surface. Thus, coral reefs and microbial mats are spared much of the impact of these plumes and are growing nearby, complete with thriving tropical fish. As ocean acidification increases across the Earth, this caldera offers scientists an opportunity to look into the future and ensure continuation of coral reef communities.</p>
